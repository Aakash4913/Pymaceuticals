In this assignment, we looked at the effects of certain treatments on 
mice.  Then I graphed data on bar and pie charts, and the amount of
timepoints for all mice tested.  

We then created a line and scatter plot for a mouse treated with Capomulin 

and lastly created a linear regression model with correlation coefficient
for mouse weight and average tumor volume.
